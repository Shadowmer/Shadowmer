- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shadowmer
- 👀 I’m interested in game development and cybersecurity
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that brings efficiency to a process or a fun game
- 📫 How to reach me: aostovic@dreampixels.games
- 😄 Pronouns: Not sure what this is (English not my native language)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am very talented when it comes to music, it takes me a few hours to learn to play an instrument. I have very little interest in that though.
